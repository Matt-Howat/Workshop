Nieves was using random forest models in attempts to show the population distribution of different areas and how that distribution was related to different covariates. Dasymetric modelling is being used to show correlations between the different covariates in an attempt to show the drive behind population distribution. The factors that seemed to compare with the population distribution most heavily were geographic topography and access to transportation systems. The authors took into consideration many different topographic factors, and it makes sense why this was one of the main factors that linked to population distribution. If the land is too dry, on too much of a slope, or covered by water then the likelihood of being able to settle in that location falls drastically. The random forest model uses many different branches to obtain a final result. With the implementation of many different random decisions it allows for the accuracy to be much greater than if it were just a single decision tree.
