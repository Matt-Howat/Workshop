## Part 1 Acquiring, Modifying and Describing the Data

![NTL and Population Graph](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/NTL%2Cpop15.png
The graph shows the variables NTL and the Population of the Dominican Republic
The R^2 value of this graph is .9198

![Covariates and Population Graph](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Plot%20of%20pop15%20and%20Covariates.png)
The graph shows the covariates (this includes water, topography, slope, etc.) and the Population
The R^2 value of this graph is .9246

![Covariates and Log of the Population Graph](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Log%20of%20Population%20and%20Covariates.png)
The graph shows the covariates aforementioned and the population
The R^2 value of this graph is .9246 as well despite the graph looking very different

## Part 2 Modeling and Predicting Spatial Values

![A plot that describes the predicted population of your LMIC using the model](

![A plot that describes the difference between your predicted results and the WorldPop estimates for 2015](

![A plot that describes the difference between your predicted results and the WorldPop estimates for 2015](

##Best Results

Accompany your series of plots with a written statement that identifies which of the three models produced the best results.  Justify your assessment.
