## Part 1: Acquiring, Modifying and Describing the Data

###NTL and Population Graph

![NTL and Population Graph](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/NTL%2Cpop15.png)
The graph shows the variables NTL and the Population of the Dominican Republic
The R^2 value of this graph is .9198

![Covariates and Population Graph](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Plot%20of%20pop15%20and%20Covariates.png)

The graph shows the covariates (this includes water, topography, slope, etc.) and the Population
The R^2 value of this graph is .9246

![Covariates and Log of the Population Graph](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Log%20of%20Population%20and%20Covariates.png)

The graph shows the covariates aforementioned and the population
The R^2 value of this graph is .9246 as well despite the graph looking very different

## Part 2: Modeling and Predicting Spatial Values

![Difference between the estimated population and the actual population](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/population%20-%20dom_pop.png)

The plot shows the difference between what the model believes is the population and the actual population in the Dominican Republic

![Open source street view of the population difference in Santo Domingo](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Santo%20Domingo%20Diff%20(Estimated%20pop%20-%20Real%20pop).png)

The plot shows the same information as the previouse however it is more specific to Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, and overlayeed the open street view

##Best Results

Accompany your series of plots with a written statement that identifies which of the three models produced the best results.  Justify your assessment.
