# Project 3

## Part 1 

![Urban Areas in Mao](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Mao_Urban_Areas2.png)

This is the defacto description of human settlements and urban areas of my slected adm, Mao. The population of Mao is 89,000. While running the program it found that there were 20 settlements with varying density and populations. The population ranged from 60,000 to 20 people. The large number of settlements that are found can be do to a loose definition of what a settlement is and the fact that the population is spread throughout Mao farily uniformaly.

## Part 2

![Roadways and Healthcare Centers Overlapping Urban Areas in Mao and Laguna Salada](https://github.com/Matt-Howat/Workshop/blob/master/Road_Healthcare_Mao_Laguna_Salada.png)

Part 2 of the project includes the stretch goal from part 1 so it includes the adm 2 of Laguna Salada. The primary roads are shown in blue showing the connection of the different large areas within the adm 2s. I think one of the best indicators for showing where the masses of people are is the residential road clusters and the health care facilities. You can see large clusters of roads around where many people are settled and these are usually accompanied by health care facilities. Not many health care facilites are seen in this adm 2 and no hospitals. This can be attributed to the low amount of funding for this country as a whole.
