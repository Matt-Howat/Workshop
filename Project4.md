### How has topography appeared to have impacted the development of urban areas?
With the mountains located around the two administrative regions that I have selected it explains the difficulty that I had in selecting administrative areas that had Urban Areas that were significant. While in both Mao and Laguna Salada there were very limited urban areas its position in a valley allowed for them to be created at all. The surrounding and very mountainouse regions did not have any urban areas that were significant, thus they did not appear when I was running my code.

### How has topography appeared to have impacted the development of transportation facilities?
The topography didn't appear to have much impact on the placment of roads. The main highway in Mao goes straight over the tallest mountain. Some of the smaller roads' sharp turns and seemingly odd shapes can be explained by smaller mountians that appear between the roads.

### How has topography appeared to have impacted the location of health care facilities?
Because of the surrounding mountains it limits the places where people can live and thus limits the places were it is efficient to place health care facilities. So the health care facilites were placed in the valleys along with the the urban areas. 

### Has producing your three-dimensional map resulted in an interpretion that is different from your previous analysis?
Creating the 3-D topography map answered a lot of questions as to why my code was working properly or picking up on data points. After creating the map I became aware that there were no data points to be had. After moving to a new administrative area the code ran without error and showed all data points.
